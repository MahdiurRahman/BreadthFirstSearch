# Breadth First Search
An algorithm which uses breadth first search to find shorted path.
This algorithm reads a large list of 4-letter words.
If you choose any two words from the list, this algorithm will give the shortest path via the changing of a single letter from the first word to the second.
Example: 
shortest path from "dare" to "make"
dare -> care -> cade -> made -> make

To run with online GDB:
1. go to https://www.onlinegdb.com/
2. on the "Languages" drop down to the upper-right, select C++14
3. Recreate my files on this IDE by copy-pasting the following files:
      NOTE: to create a new file to paste onto, click the "New File" icon on the upper-left
   4LetterWordsReduced.dat
   main.cpp
   word.h
   bfs.h
   bfs.cpp
4. Click the green "Run" button on the upper-left (next to "New File")

You can run this on any C++ ide including visual studios or the Linux CMD. I just use OnlineGDB because it's accessible to everyone.
