# Breadth First Search
An algorithm which uses breadth first search to find shorted path

NOTE: This little project of mine is unfinished.
The algorithm actually works, as you can use the debug window to see how the individual data-points (words in my case) point back to each other in a chain that is indeed the shortest (optimal) path. But for some reason I am having trouble actually displaying the path. It is most likely a problem with the my "Word.h" datatype.
